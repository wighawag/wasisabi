# Run the demo VM using the HOST's qemu, for non-NixOS hosts.
#
# Why this exists:
#   The VM asks for `-device virtio-vga-gl` (see hosts/demo.nix). That is not
#   optional eye candy: niri refuses to run on a software EGL renderer, so
#   without a real GPU render node in the guest you get a black screen.
#
#   The qemu from nixpkgs *does* support virtio-vga-gl. What it cannot do on a
#   non-NixOS host is load that host's GL drivers: it looks for them under
#   /run/opengl-driver/lib/gbm, a path that only exists on NixOS, and dies with
#     MESA-LOADER: failed to open dri: /run/opengl-driver/lib/gbm/dri_gbm.so
#     qemu-system-x86_64: egl: render node init failed
#   The host's own qemu finds the host's Mesa in the usual places and works.
#
#   So: on NixOS, run ./result/bin/run-nixos-vm. Everywhere else, run this.
#
# Why the disk image is recreated every run:
#   In a NixOS build-vm the guest's /nix/store is an overlay whose upper layer
#   is a *tmpfs*, while /home and /nix/var live on the qcow2 and persist. So on
#   a second boot of the same image, the Nix database and the home-manager
#   profile still point at store paths that were wiped with the tmpfs, and
#   activation fails with
#     error: opening file '/nix/store/...-user-environment.drv': No such file
#     [FAILED] Failed to start Home Manager environment for demo
#   Reusing a demo image is therefore not supported. It is a demo: state is
#   meant to be disposable. Pass --keep if you want to reuse one anyway and
#   accept that activation will fail.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/run-vm-gl.sh [--keep] [path/to/run-nixos-vm]
