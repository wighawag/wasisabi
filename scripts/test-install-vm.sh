# End-to-end install test: boot the installer ISO in QEMU, let it install onto
# a blank disk, then boot THAT DISK and check what came out.
#
# Evaluating is not verifying, and neither is a successful install: the
# interesting question is whether the machine that was just written to disk
# boots, comes up healthy, and is the machine its own flake describes. So this
# runs in four stages, each of which can fail on its own:
#
#   1. install   boot the autotest ISO, which runs wasisabi-install unattended
#                against a blank disk and powers off. Watches the serial log
#                for the success sentinel.
#   2. boot      boot the installed disk with a real GPU (virtio-vga-gl under
#                egl-headless, because niri refuses software EGL) and take a
#                screenshot of the login screen.
#   3. inspect   boot the ISO again with the installed disk attached, mount it,
#                and check the installed system from outside: the user, the
#                hostname, the keymap, the generated flake, failed units.
#   4. rebuild   on that same mounted system, rebuild /etc/nixos OFFLINE and
#                check it produces exactly the system that was installed. This
#                is the one that proves the generated flake is real rather
#                than decorative.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/test-install-vm.sh [--luks] [--offline] [--stage N]
#
# The disk image is always kept afterwards, for inspection.
