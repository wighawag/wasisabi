# THE ASSISTANT, MADE VISIBLE. The system layer (../modules/agents.nix) runs a
# wherever for the machine's owner: a web UI for pi agent sessions on the
# local model, loopback only. Until now the only way to find it was to know
# that `wherever-link` exists. This module puts it where a new user looks:
#
#   - a launcher entry ("Assistant"), in fuzzel and in Noctalia's launcher
#   - a keybind, Mod+A
#   - a bar button (Waybar here; Noctalia's comes from its seed, see noctalia.nix)
#   - a welcome notification on the first graphical login, shown once and
#     only after Noctalia's own intro is closed (after-noctalia-intro, noctalia.nix)
#
# All four run the same command, `wasisabi-assistant`, which asks
# `wherever-link` for the URL AT CLICK TIME. That is the one design constraint:
# the URL carries the access token (in the fragment, which a browser never
# sends), the token is minted on the machine at first start and readable only
# by the owner, and it must never reach the store. So nothing here may bake the
# URL into a file; a bookmark or a browser homepage set at build time would
# have to. Resolving it on each click also means a token rotation (delete
# /var/lib/wherever/token, restart wherever) is picked up with no rebuild.
#
# WHY KEEP THE TOKEN AT ALL on a loopback-only server, when a mesh-only box
# (the fleet's telemaque) runs without one: loopback is not a boundary against
# THIS machine's browsers. wherever answers with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
# *` and does not check Host, so without a token any web page open in any
# local browser could drive an agent with full access to the owner's home,
# directly or by DNS rebinding. Two such browsers are always here: the owner's
# own, and webhands' Chromium, which agents point at arbitrary pages. On a mesh
# box, those browsers are not on the same host as the server; here they are.
