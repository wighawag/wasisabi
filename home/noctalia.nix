# Noctalia: one shell owning bar, dock, launcher, control center,
# notifications, wallpaper, lock screen, OSDs and clipboard history, instead of
# the five single-purpose daemons in desktop.nix. MIT, native Wayland + OpenGL
# ES, no Qt or GTK dependency.
#
# BUILT FROM SOURCE, NOT CONSUMED AS A FLAKE, and that is a deliberate choice
# with a concrete payoff: upstream's flake pins its own nixos-unstable, so
# taking their outputs drags a SECOND nixpkgs into every consumer's closure and
# makes the shell's GL stack disagree with the compositor's. Their
# `nix/package.nix` is a plain callPackage file, so building it against OUR
# pkgs sidesteps that entirely and keeps one nixpkgs per machine. The source
# is pinned in flake.lock and injected as `noctaliaSrc`.
#
# WE ALSO DO NOT USE THEIR HOME MODULE, for a sharper reason. It sets
# `xdg.configFile."noctalia/config.toml".source`, which makes the config a
# READ-ONLY STORE SYMLINK -- and Noctalia's whole configuration model is a
# settings GUI with hot reload. A shell whose settings panel cannot save is
# worse than one with no settings panel. This module therefore SEEDS the
# config once and never touches it again: the app owns the file.
#
# That is the same rule this repo applies elsewhere (settings.json is seeded,
# not owned) and the one my-boxes learned from `~/.config/git/config` being a
# store symlink, which makes `git config --global` fail forever.

  # The seed. Deliberately MINIMAL: enough that a fresh machine looks right
  # (the font the rest of the desktop uses, a dark theme), and nothing else.
  # Every other setting is the GUI's business, and anything written here that
  # the user later changes would look like a setting that "resets itself" if
  # this file were ever re-applied.
  #
  # The one addition is the assistant's bar button (home/assistant.nix), when
  # this home has an assistant. It needs the whole `end` list spelled out,
  # since Noctalia replaces rather than extends it: this is upstream's default
  # (src/config/config_types.h) with "assistant" in front. Being part of the
  # seed, it reaches only a home seeded after it exists; an existing config is
  # the user's, so add the widget there from the settings GUI if wanted.
