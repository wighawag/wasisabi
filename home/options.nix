        Which desktop SHELL owns the bar, launcher, notifications, lock
        screen, wallpaper and OSDs.

        "noctalia" is one cohesive shell (MIT, native Wayland/GLES) that owns
        all of those surfaces, configured through its own settings GUI with
        hot reload. This module SEEDS its config once and then leaves it
        alone: the app owns the file, so the GUI can actually save.

        "classic" is the original stack of single-purpose pieces: Waybar +
        fuzzel + mako + swaylock + swayidle. More parts to keep visually
        consistent, but each is independently replaceable and every setting
        is declarative.

        The compositor is niri either way; this option changes only the
        shell layer around it.

      description = ''
        Compositor animations (window open/close, workspace switch, strip
        scrolling, overview).

        Turn this off on machines with no accelerated GPU driver: under
        llvmpipe every animation frame is a full-screen CPU blit, which is
        the difference between smooth and unusable. The demo VM sets this
        to false for exactly that reason.

        File manager, and the one bound to Mod+E.

        "yazi" is the odd one and worth understanding before picking it: it
        is a TUI, so it opens IN THE TERMINAL and has no XDG portal
        implementation. That does NOT cost you a file chooser -- "open a
        file" from Firefox is answered by the GTK PORTAL, which brings its
        own dialog and never involved Thunar (see modules/desktop.nix, where
        niri's `useNautilus` is off for exactly this reason). So choosing
        yazi means "no GUI file manager installed", not "no way to pick a
        file".

        "none" installs nothing and leaves Mod+E opening a terminal.
