# Releasing

How wasisabi's ISOs get from a git tag to [wasisabi.org](https://wasisabi.org). The routine part is one script, [`scripts/release.sh`](../scripts/release.sh); the rest of this note is the one-time Cloudflare setup it depends on, and why it is shaped the way it is.

## Where the downloads live

A Cloudflare R2 bucket, `wasisabi-releases`, served at `https://downloads.wasisabi.org` (a custom domain on the bucket), laid out as one folder per version plus an index:

```
v0.2.0/wasisabi-offline.iso      the live ISO, about 9 GB
v0.2.0/wasisabi-netinstall.iso   the text installer, about 1.6 GB
v0.2.0/SHA256SUMS
releases.json                    what is downloadable, newest first
```

The website reads `releases.json` in the browser, so publishing or deleting a version changes the site's download card without rebuilding the site. A version's files are never changed once written.

Why R2: downloads (egress) are free, storage is $0.015 per GB-month with 10 GB free, and GitHub releases cap a file at 2 GiB, which the live ISO is far over.

## One-time setup (Cloudflare dashboard)

The domain `wasisabi.org` has to be on Cloudflare (its DNS, not necessarily its registration) and shown as **Active** there.

1. **Create the bucket.** R2 Object Storage (the first time, R2 has to be enabled, which asks for a payment method even on the free tier) → **Create bucket**: name `wasisabi-releases`, location Automatic, storage class Standard.
2. **Connect the download domain.** The bucket → **Settings** → **Custom Domains** → **Add** → `downloads.wasisabi.org`. Cloudflare creates the DNS record itself; wait for **Active**. Leave the Public Development URL (`r2.dev`) disabled: it is rate-limited and meant for testing.
3. **Let the website read the index (CORS).** Same Settings page → **CORS Policy** → **Add**:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "AllowedOrigins": [
         "https://wasisabi.org",
         "https://www.wasisabi.org",
         "https://wighawag.github.io",
         "http://localhost:5173",
         "http://localhost:4791"
       ],
       "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"]
     }
   ]
   ```

   The localhost entries are the website's dev server and preview. The same rules, in wrangler's format, are in [`scripts/release-cors.json`](../scripts/release-cors.json).
4. **An upload key.** R2 Object Storage → **Manage API tokens** → **Create Account API token**: permission **Object Read & Write**, **Apply to specific buckets only** → `wasisabi-releases`, and a short TTL if it is for one release. Keep three values: the **Access Key ID**, the **Secret Access Key** (shown once), and the **Account ID** (in the S3 endpoint `https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`).
5. **Give them to the script**, in the environment or in `~/.config/wasisabi/r2.env` (then `chmod 600` it):

   ```sh
   R2_ACCOUNT_ID=...
   R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
   R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
   ```

The same setup with wrangler instead of the dashboard, once `wrangler login` has been run:

```sh
wrangler r2 bucket create wasisabi-releases
wrangler r2 bucket domain add wasisabi-releases --domain downloads.wasisabi.org --zone-id <zone id of wasisabi.org>
wrangler r2 bucket cors set wasisabi-releases --file scripts/release-cors.json
```

(The upload key is still made in the dashboard: wrangler cannot create one.)

## A release

```sh
git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0
scripts/release.sh publish 0.2.0 --dry-run   # builds, checksums, shows every upload and deletion
scripts/release.sh publish 0.2.0             # ... and does them
```

`publish`:

1. refuses a tag that is not on GitHub, then builds both ISOs from `github:wighawag/wasisabi/v0.2.0`, so what is published is what anyone can rebuild;
2. uploads them and a `SHA256SUMS` under `v0.2.0/` (rclone, multipart: a single R2 upload stops at 5 GiB);
3. puts the version first in `releases.json`;
4. **keeps only the newest version** (`--keep N` for more) and deletes the rest from the bucket;
5. writes the download links and checksums into the GitHub release's notes, creating the release if needed. That is a second channel: someone who could tamper with the bucket still could not make GitHub agree.

Other commands:

```sh
scripts/release.sh delete 0.1.0   # one version's folder and index entry
scripts/release.sh list           # the index, and what the bucket really holds
```

## Why only one version

Stealth mode: an offline ISO costs about $0.14 a month to keep, and nobody needs an old one yet. Nothing is lost by deleting, because the ISOs are reproducible from their tag: the netinstall ISO rebuilt from `v0.1.0` came out byte-identical (same SHA-256) to the one published before. `nix build github:wighawag/wasisabi/vX.Y.Z#iso-offline` brings any version back. When old versions start to matter, publish with `--keep 3` (or more).
