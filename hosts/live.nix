# THE LIVE SESSION on the offline medium: the wasisabi desktop, logged in
# automatically as the installer's `nixos` user (no password, passwordless
# sudo, both from NixOS's installation-device profile), so the machine can be
# tried before anything touches its disk. Imported by hosts/iso.nix when
# `live` is set.
#
# The boot menu's default entry is this; a second entry, "text installer",
# is the old medium exactly (see `specialisation.installer` below), for a
# machine whose graphics are the problem or a person who just wants to install.

  # What greetd runs for the live user, at autologin and whenever someone logs
  # in again from the greeter. The render-node test is the whole point: niri
  # refuses a software renderer, so without it a GPU-less machine would show a
  # black screen with niri running perfectly behind it. This turns that into
  # a sentence on the screen and a working shell.
  #
  # WAIT FOR THE GPU DRIVER FIRST. greetd can start before udev has loaded the
  # GPU's kernel module (on the medium it is not in the initrd; amdgpu takes
  # seconds on real laptops). `udevadm settle` waits for the coldplug queue to
  # drain, and the poll covers a driver that registers its node a moment later.
  #
  # A PLAIN GLOB, NOT `compgen -G`: scripts run under nixpkgs' non-interactive
  # bash, which is built without programmable completion, so `compgen` does
  # not exist there, and the test failed silently on a machine with a GPU.

      wasisabi live: this machine has no usable GPU (no /dev/dri/renderD*),
      and the desktop needs one, so it was not started.

  # THE KEYBOARD, CHOSEN IN THE LIVE SESSION. The medium cannot know the
  # keyboard in front of it (a keyboard does not report its layout), so it
  # boots on US and asks, once, in the welcome terminal: Enter keeps US, a few
  # letters find another. Also on PATH as `wasisabi-keyboard`, and in the
  # launcher, for changing it again.
  #
  # IT GOES THROUGH systemd-localed, the one place niri reads the layout from
  # (home/desktop.nix leaves niri's own xkb block empty), and niri follows
  # localed's PropertiesChanged signal, so the running desktop switches at
  # once, with no restart. The same localed is what the installer then reads
  # to offer this layout as its default. `--no-convert` leaves the text
  # console alone: nothing here types on it, and the installer sets it
  # itself from its own answer.

  # Picking from a list rather than typing a layout code, because the person

      Welcome to the wasisabi live session.

      It runs from the USB stick and from RAM.
      Nothing is written to this computer's
      disks, and nothing done here survives a
      reboot.

      Things to try:
        Super+A            the assistant, in the
                           browser (same agent)
        pi                 an AI coding agent, on a
                           model running on this CPU
                           (the first answer waits
                           while the model loads)
        webveil search ..  private web search
        sudo anonctl use anon
                           an account whose traffic
                           all goes through Tor
                           (needs a network)

    This computer is running wasisabi from a USB stick, from memory, as the user `nixos`. Nothing is written to its disks and nothing done here survives a reboot, so there is no `~/nixos` configuration to change: a fix that should last belongs in the installed system. To install: `sudo wasisabi-install`, in a terminal. To change the keyboard layout: `wasisabi-keyboard`, in a terminal.

    Here `sudo` needs no password in a terminal, and is refused in the web UI. Still ask before using it.
