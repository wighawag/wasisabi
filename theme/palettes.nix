# The desktop's palettes, as data. Every app that draws colour reads its
# colours from here through `wasisabi.theme`, so a palette is one attrset and
# not a hunt through a dozen config files.
#
# Hex without the leading '#', because the consumers disagree about it (niri
# and CSS want it, swaylock, foot and fuzzel refuse it).
#
# The roles, same keys in every palette:
#   base mantle crust            backgrounds, from the window to the deepest
#   surface0..2, overlay0        raised surfaces, borders, muted text
#   subtext text bright          text, from secondary to emphasised
#   focus                        the focused window's ring
#   highlight                    the ONE thing to look at: the current
#                                workspace, a launcher match, the clock
#   info                         links and borders that are not the focus
#   urgent warning success       states
#   ansi                         the 16 terminal colours, 0..15

  # Sumi (墨, ink): sampled from the default wallpaper, the enso risograph.
