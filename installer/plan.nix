# The installer's question plan: what gets asked, in what order, under which
# heading, and -- for anything NOT asked -- why not.
#
# This file is the only hand-maintained half of the installer's questions. The
# other half (prompt text, type, allowed values, default) is read out of the
# option declarations themselves by ./questions.nix, so an option and its
# question cannot describe different things.
#
# THE COVERAGE RULE. Every leaf option in modules/options.nix and
# home/options.nix must appear exactly once, either in a group below or in
# `skip` with a reason. questions.nix throws otherwise, and that throw is a
# flake check, so adding an option to the API without deciding its installer
# story fails the build rather than silently producing an installer that
# cannot reach half the system.
#
# Keys are layer-qualified: "system:greetd.greeter", "home:terminal". Items
# with a `kind` are the installer's own questions (identity, disks), which are
# not wasisabi options and therefore have nothing to read a declaration from.
