# The flake.lock (and matching input URL) the installer writes into the user's
# new flake.
#
# WHY THIS IS SYNTHESISED RATHER THAN RESOLVED ON THE TARGET. If the installed
# flake arrived unlocked, the machine's first `nixos-rebuild` would resolve
# `nixos-unstable` to whatever is current that day, download a second nixpkgs
# and rebuild the world -- from a different revision than the one that was
# just installed and tested. Worse, an offline install could not resolve it at
# all. So the ISO ships a lock pinned to exactly the inputs it was built from:
# the machine you booted is the machine you get, and `nix flake update` later
# is a decision its owner makes rather than a side effect of first boot.
#
# It is derived from this repo's own flake.lock by promoting the root node to
# a `wasisabi` node and giving the user's flake a new root over the same input
# nodes. Same revisions, same narHashes, so the store paths the medium carries
# are exactly the ones the target flake asks for. (A GitHub tarball and a
# clean local checkout of the same revision produce an identical narHash and
# an identical store path, which is what makes this work offline.)
#
# TWO MODES, and the difference is visible in the installed flake rather than
# hidden:
#
#   committed tree -> wasisabi is pinned as github:wighawag/wasisabi at that
#                     revision. The normal case, and an ordinary flake that
#                     `nix flake update` can move forward.
#
#   dirty tree     -> wasisabi is pinned as a path: into the medium's own
#                     store. The installed machine is then self-contained and
#                     reproduces the exact tree the ISO was built from,
#                     including uncommitted edits, which is what you want when
#                     testing an installer and never what you want to hand to
#                     someone else. The generated flake says so in its input
#                     URL rather than pretending to be a release.
#
# The second mode is also the mechanism that would serve a PRIVATE repository,
# where `github:` is not fetchable by the person installing.
