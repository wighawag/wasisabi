# THIS SCRIPT CONTAINS NO CONFIGURATION TEXT, and that is the point. Every
# line it writes comes either from template/ (which is also what
# `nix flake new -t github:wighawag/wasisabi` scaffolds by hand) or from the
# answers, whose names, types and defaults come from the option declarations
# via installer/questions.nix. There is no second copy of the config to drift.
#
# It is a separate entry point from install.sh so that the emit step can be
# run, diffed and evaluated without a disk, which is what the flake check
# `emit-roundtrip` does.
#
#   emit.sh --questions Q.json --answers A.json --template DIR --out DIR
#
# Answers are a flat JSON object of "layer:path" keys, matching questions.json:
#   { "identity:hostname": "kestrel", "system:tor.enable": "false", ... }
