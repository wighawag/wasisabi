# Whole-disk layout with an encrypted root: GPT, an unencrypted EFI system
# partition, and everything else inside LUKS2, unlocked by passphrase in the
# initrd at every boot.
#
# What is NOT encrypted, stated plainly: the ESP, which holds the kernel and
# the initrd. That is unavoidable without Secure Boot and measured boot, and
# it means this protects a powered-off machine against someone reading the
# disk, not against someone who can modify the boot partition and hand it back
# to you.
#
# The passphrase is typed on the keyboard layout chosen during installation,
# because wasisabi.keyboard.layout feeds console.useXkbConfig and so reaches
# the initrd. That is the single most important reason the layout is an option
# rather than something set after first boot.
#
# USED AT INSTALL TIME ONLY: nixos-generate-config detects the LUKS device and
# writes the boot.initrd.luks.devices entry into hardware-configuration.nix,
# so the installed system unlocks without disko being present.
