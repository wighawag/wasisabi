# The owner's secrets, sops-encrypted in their own flake and decrypted by
# sops-nix on activation. The sops-nix module itself is imported by
# `nixosModules.wasisabi` in flake.nix, so the generated flake needs no input
# of its own for it and the installed machine's lock pins it like the rest.
#
# THE MODEL: one age key per machine flake, held in two places. The machine
# has it at `secrets.ageKeyFile` (root-only) to decrypt at activation; the
# owner has a copy in ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt to edit with `sops`, and a
# backup somewhere that is not this machine. A reinstall is then "the flake +
# that key": nothing to re-encrypt, no second key to enrol.
#
# Only VALUES can be secret. sops-nix decrypts on the machine, after Nix has
# evaluated the config, so anything evaluation needs (the username, the
# hostname, which services run) is necessarily in the clear.
