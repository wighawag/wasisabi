  # definition does not merge with a mkDefault one, it DISCARDS it. So with
  # mkDefault here the nerd font silently never got installed, fontconfig
  # substituted DejaVu Sans, and terminals rendered a PROPORTIONAL font --
  # visibly ragged, with foot warning "font does not appear to be monospace"
  # on every launch. The demo VM had it too.
