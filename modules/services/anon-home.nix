# modules/anon-home.nix
#
# THE CONTENT of anonctl's anon account homes, so a slot is a working,
# CREDENTIAL-FREE agent the moment it is entered. Third sibling to
# modules/anon-accounts.nix (the passwd slots) and modules/anon-dns.nix (name
# resolution); this one owns what is INSIDE the home and nothing else. It
# declares no nftables rule, no unit and no anonctl invocation, and it must
# never run anonctl at activation: the forcing, the ledger and the exemptions
# stay anonctl's own imperative state.
#
# WHY THE HOST OWNS THIS AT ALL, which is a deliberate split rather than a gap
# anonctl forgot. anonctl 0.6.1 CAN seed a home, from the directory-exists
# convention `/etc/anonctl/default-home/`, and it refuses to use it here:
#
#     // On FRESH creation only ... An ADOPTED account (Created=false) is never
#     // seeded, mirroring the login-env write: its home is whoever declared
#     // it's, and anonctl is not entitled to drop files into it.
#                                                   (anonctl main.go, `add`)
#
# On this box EVERY anon account is adopted, by construction and permanently:
# modules/anon-accounts.nix declares the slots because `users.mutableUsers =
# false` would otherwise delete them at each activation, so they always exist
# before `anonctl add` runs and `res.Created` is always false. So
# `/etc/anonctl/default-home/` would never fire for a single account on this
# host, and the module that declared the accounts is exactly the "whoever
# declared it" anonctl is deferring to. Hence: here.
#
# WHAT THE SYMPTOM WAS. `sudo anonctl use anon-01`, then `pi`, warned "No
# models available". Not a broken jail and not a broken model server: the
# account simply had no provider configuration at all, because
# wasisabi.services.piUser is scoped to `user = "wighawag"` and nothing had ever
# written into an anon home.
#
# ── THE ALLOWLIST IS THE SECURITY BOUNDARY ──────────────────────────────────
#
# An anon account exists to be UNATTRIBUTABLE, so the question for every file
# is not "is it useful" but "does it carry identity". Nothing identity-bearing
# may land here: no sops secret, no API key, no auth.json, no GitHub token, no
# git user.name/email, no ssh key, no path naming the operator.
#
# That rule is enforced by CONSTRUCTION rather than by this comment, in three
# ways, because a documented rule is one careless option away from a leak.
# THEY ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF GUARD and the difference matters:
#
#   1. PROVENANCE. Every file source must be a STORE PATH (`isStorePath`). A
#      repo-relative path literal interpolates to /nix/store/...; a sops secret
#      is `config.sops.secrets.<x>.path`, i.e. the STRING "/run/secrets/<x>",
#      which interpolates to itself and is refused at evaluation. sops-nix
#      decrypts at ACTIVATION and never renders into the store, so for SOPS
#      specifically, "is a store path" and "is not a secret" are the same test.
#
#      THIS PROVES NOTHING ABOUT CONTENT, and saying otherwise was this
#      module's first bug. `agentsFile = ../../hosts/telemaque/home/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`
#      is a store path and passes, and it is the operator's portrait: exactly
#      the failure the agentsFile option calls the most direct way this module
#      could fail. So provenance is necessary and nowhere near sufficient.
#
#   2. CONTENT. Everything this module renders into an anon home is SCANNED at
#      evaluation (`contentOffenders`) and the build fails if it carries a
#      credential-shaped literal (/run/secrets, ghp_/gho_/github_pat_, sk-, a
#      PRIVATE KEY block, an apiKey that is not "none") or the NAME OF ANY
#      OTHER ACCOUNT ON THIS BOX. That last one is derived from
#      `users.users` rather than hardcoded, so it needs no maintenance and
#      catches the operator's home path, their username in a prose file, and
#      any future human account, without this module being told who they are.
#      ADR-0013 asks for exactly this check, in these words: "the declared seed
#      must contain no credential-shaped literal", converting a runtime refusal
#      into a build-time impossibility.
#
#      PLUS ONE EXACT-MATCH CHECK for the named worst case: an agentsFile whose
#      content equals the OPERATOR's declared policy file is refused outright.
#      That check is not redundant, it is load-bearing, and the measurement says
#      why: the operator's AGENTS.md on this box contains ZERO occurrences of
#      their username. It is a portrait drawn in conventions rather than names,
#      so the substring scan above does not see it at all.
#
#      ITS LIMITS, STATED, because a guard trusted past its range is worse than
#      no guard. It scans FILES this module renders or reads (models.json,
#      settings.json, AGENTS.md, the login profile). It does NOT recurse into a
#      `skills` directory: that is a store tree of unbounded size and eval-time
#      recursion over it is not worth the build cost, so a skill is covered by
#      provenance only, which is one more reason the default skill set is empty.
#      And it cannot catch a file that is identity-bearing WITHOUT containing a
#      username or a credential shape, which, per the measurement above, is a
#      real category and not a theoretical one. For that, the defences are the
#      default (a purpose-written anon file) and review of the diff. The checks
#      raise the floor; they are not a substitute for reading what you declare.
#
#   3. SCHEMA. The provider record has NO credential field. models.json is
#      BUILT here from `endpoint` + `models`, and `apiKey` is the literal
#      "none", written by this module. There is no option through which a key
#      could be passed, so the rendered file cannot carry one even by mistake.
#      Contrast the operator's models.json, which modules/pi-user.nix correctly
#      calls "~90% CREDENTIALS" and keeps wholly in sops.
#
# ── DECLARED vs SEEDED, the trap modules/pi-user.nix already hit ────────────
#
# A store symlink is READ-ONLY. Anything the application legitimately writes
# to therefore cannot be one (pi-user.nix learned this on auth.json, which pi
# rewrites at every token refresh, and which is consequently seeded rather than
# declared). Sorted for this module:
#
#   models.json    DECLARED (L+). pi never writes it; the operator's own copy
#                  is a 0400 sops file and has worked that way since it landed.
#   settings.json  DECLARED (L+), with eyes open. pi would like to write
#                  `lastChangelogVersion` here and cannot. That is the exact
#                  trade the operator's box already makes and accepts, and it
#                  matters more here: `enabledModels` IS pi's model picker, so
#                  an anon session that could edit it could also point itself
#                  at a provider this module deliberately did not give it.
#   AGENTS.md      DECLARED (L+). It is policy; policy that drifts per account
#                  with no diff and no review is worse than no policy.
#   .bash_profile  DECLARED (L+). Login environment, never written by a tool.
#   .pi/agent/     A REAL DIRECTORY, 0700, owned by the account. pi writes its
#                  session store and any npm extension tree underneath, so the
#                  DIRECTORY must be writable even though the files named above
#                  inside it are not.
#   auth.json      ABSENT, and the one file this module will never declare in
#                  any form. It is where a credential would live.
#
# ── OWNERSHIP: `d` DOES NOT CHOWN AN EXISTING DIRECTORY, `Z` DOES ───────────
#
# hosts/telemaque/default.nix carries the scar: the operator's `.agents` tree
# came out root-owned because only the leaf was declared, and `ln` in their own
# skills directory failed with "Permission denied". Every tree here is
# therefore `d` (create with the right mode) PLUS `Z` (recursively correct the
# ownership of whatever is already there). The group is the ACCOUNT'S OWN
# GROUP, never `users`: modules/anon-accounts.nix gives each slot a dedicated
# group precisely so that group-readable files are not mutually visible between
# the operator and an account whose whole purpose is to be unlinkable to them.
#
# ── ONE ANONYMITY NIT, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED ────────────────────────
#
# Every slot gets a BYTE-IDENTICAL home. If the slots are meant to be DISTINCT
# identities, that identical setup is a shared behavioural fingerprint: same
# standing instructions, same model, same tool surface, so two slots produce
# recognisably the same agent, and anything that correlates their output
# correlates the identities. Against the LAN model this home points at, that is
# minor (the observer is a box on the operator's own shelf). It stops being
# minor if a slot is ever pointed at a REMOTE provider, which is a second
# reason this module only knows how to name a LAN endpoint. Per-slot variation
# is deliberately not offered here: it would have to be real variation in
# instructions and model choice to be worth anything, and a knob that produces
# cosmetic differences would only make the fingerprint look addressed.

      # WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS READ AT ALL. Three steps, in this
      # order, which is the bit worth getting right because two of them look
      # contradictory out of sequence:
      #
      #   1. `anonctl use` execs `setpriv ... <shell> -l` with argv0 prefixed by
      #      `-`, handing it a deliberately spartan environment whose PATH is
      #      /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin. On NixOS those three hold nothing but
      #      /usr/bin/env and /bin/sh. anonctl expects the account's own profile
      #      drop-in to refine it, and writes that drop-in only for accounts it
      #      CREATED, so an adopted account (i.e. every account here) has none.
      #   2. Because `-l` makes it a LOGIN shell, bash reads /etc/profile, which
      #      sources set-environment, which OVERWRITES PATH with an absolute list
      #      including /run/current-system/sw/bin. So the spartan PATH from step 1
      #      never survives to be observed: `pi` and `anonctl` resolve fine.
      #   3. Then, still because it is a login shell, bash reads THIS file, which
      #      is therefore the correct and only hook for adjusting what step 2 set.
      #
      # The functional answer is thus "PATH is already sane, the host need not
      # declare a login env to make the account WORK". This file is not here for
      # that.
      #
      # WHAT IS NOT SANE is what that fleet-wide PATH NAMES. modules/dev-toolchain.nix
      # appends the operator's own toolchain prefixes box-wide, so every account on
      # this machine, including this one, gets an environment reading
      # /home/<operator>/.npm-global/bin:/home/<operator>/.cargo/bin:/home/<operator>/go/bin.
      # Those directories are unreachable from here (the operator's home is 0700),
      # so this is not an escape and not a code-execution path: they are dead
      # entries. They are still the operator's NAME, three times, in the
      # environment of a session whose entire purpose is to not be attributable to
      # them, one `echo $PATH` or one env-dumping tool away from an agent's
      # context window.
      #
      # PATH IS ONLY ONE OF TEN. Measured on this box rather than assumed: the
      # generated set-environment names that home in PATH, GTK_PATH, INFOPATH,
      # LIBEXEC_PATH, QTWEBKIT_PLUGIN_PATH, TERMINFO_DIRS, XCURSOR_PATH,
      # XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, XDG_DATA_DIRS and NIX_PROFILES, plus NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
      # which is a bare value rather than a list. An earlier version of this file
      # filtered PATH alone while its comment claimed to have addressed "the
      # operator's name in the environment", which was nine tenths wrong.
      #
      # THIS IS A MITIGATION, NOT THE ROOT FIX, and the distinction is worth
      # keeping honest. The root fix is that operator-specific prefixes should not
      # be declared box-wide at all (environment.profiles + environment.variables

        The LAN model server as an EXACT `IP:port`, used to build the
        credential-free baseUrl.

        RAW IP AND MANDATORY PORT, enforced by an assertion rather than asked
        for politely, and the form is not cosmetic. A hostname would be a
        hijackable redirect for AI traffic (a poisoned name points model calls,
        which carry prompt content, at someone else's endpoint) and this is
        precisely the traffic that must not be redirected. The same literal is
        also what anonctl's `--allow` takes: it refuses hostnames and
        port-omitted values outright (its ADR-0007), because a bare IP exemption
        opens every port on that host, which deanonymizes the account the moment
        that host runs a forwarding proxy. So this option and the exemption
        speak the SAME grammar, and the literal set here is the literal passed
        to the exemption, e.g. for 192.168.1.150:8080:

          sudo anonctl update <account> --endpoint socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050 \
            --allow 192.168.1.150:8080

        THIS MODULE CANNOT CREATE THAT HOLE. Declaring an endpoint here only
        writes a config file naming it; until the exemption above is applied,
        a session's connection to it is redirected into the shim like any other
        and the model is simply unreachable. That asymmetry is deliberate: a
        deploy must never be able to punch a hole in a jail.

        OFF BY DEFAULT, so an anon home stays exactly what it was until a host
        asks for this. Turning it on changes what an anon session can reach

          The pi-webveil package, taken from the STORE rather than installed
          from npm at session start.

          WHY THE STORE. pi installs `packages` entries from npm when a session
          starts. For an anon account every such fetch crosses the jail (npm
          over Tor), which is slow, observable, and can fail closed, leaving a
          session with no web tools. A store path makes session start fully
          offline and makes the extension version-pinned and rollback-covered
          like every other tool on the box. That pi ACCEPTS an absolute store
          path is measured, not assumed: see
          work/notes/findings/pi-loads-store-path-extensions-and-uwsgi-socket-activation-needs-fd3.md.

          The exact path handed to pi comes from the package's own
          `extensionSubdir` passthru, never spelled here, because the failure
          mode for a wrong subpath is SILENCE: pi's local resolution is a bare
          `if (!existsSync(resolved)) return;`, so a typo costs the account its
          web tools with no warning, no error and exit 0. An assertion below

          module cannot disagree about the path; whoever serves it reads this
          rather than restating it.

          A UNIX SOCKET IS NOT A CHOICE OF STYLE HERE. An anon account cannot
          serve a loopback TCP port at all: anonctl's closure ends in
          `meta skuid <anon> ip daddr 127.0.0.0/8 drop`, and an inbound
          connection's REPLY packets carry the listening socket owner's uid, so
          the SYN arrives and the SYN-ACK is dropped. A unix socket is not IP
          traffic and traverses no nftables chain. Measured: see
          work/notes/findings/anon-uid-cannot-serve-inbound-tcp-the-reply-is-dropped.md.

          IN /run, NOT IN THE HOME, amending ADR-0017's "a socket in that
          account's home" after building it. Three reasons, none of them
          security: /run is a tmpfs, so a stale socket cannot outlive a reboot
          (RemoveOnStop covers a clean stop but not a crash or a power cut, so
          this makes it structural rather than best-effort); the account's home
          stays PURELY this module's declared content, instead of having another
          module write into a directory this one owns, which matters because the
          wherever instance will want the same treatment; and nothing that walks
          a home (a backup, a sync, a plain `ls`) trips over a socket.

          SECURITY IS UNCHANGED BY THE MOVE, which is why it was safe to make:
          `connect()` needs write permission on the socket inode, so
          `SocketMode=0600` plus `SocketUser=<account>` is the whole gate, and
          the per-account parent directory is created 0700 and account-owned so
          the defence-in-depth the 0700 home used to provide is preserved
          exactly. modules/anon-search.nix owns that tmpfiles rule, next to the
          socket unit that depends on it.

        operator: it names their home directory layout, their repositories,
        their worktree convention, their box names, their printer and their
        systemd unit, and its instructions assume credentials, git remotes and

        TWO GUARDS APPLY, and they are different. It must be a STORE PATH

        evaluation for credential shapes and for the name of any other account

        Item by item:

          - dorfl's sixteen are work/-protocol skills. They instruct an agent to
            claim tasks, commit, open and merge PRs. An anon account has no git
            identity, no forge credential and no repository, so they are at best
            inert and at worst a standing instruction to do the exact things
            this module's AGENTS.md forbids. OUT, with the caveat that some of
            them need only a COMMIT rather than a push, so the set is not
            uniformly inapplicable and is worth revisiting deliberately.
          - reconcile-template-tree operates on the operator's template tree,
            and print-doc drives a physical printer, which is a location and is
            the operator's. OUT, permanently.
          - accommodation-hunt is real-world identity by construction. OUT.
          - the credential-free, machine-local ones (diagnosing-bugs, tdd,
            codebase-design, writing-for-agents, prototype, grilling, research,
            use-webhands) are IN: they change how a session works, not who it
            is.

        USE-WEBHANDS IS IN, AND THE OBJECTION RECORDED HERE BEFORE WAS FALSE.
        It said the skill "drives a browser the OPERATOR is logged into. Handing
        that to an anon session does not leak an identity, it USES one." That
        does not survive contact with this box: the operator's home is 0700 and
        the unit that hosts these sessions runs ProtectHome=tmpfs with only the
        account's own home bound, so an anon session cannot reach the operator's
        browser profile and, in a hosted session, that profile does not exist in
        the filesystem view at all. webhands resolves its profile under $HOME
        (~/.webhands/profiles/<name>), so a slot drives ITS OWN profile because
        of where its home is, not because anything asked it to.

        THE REAL CONSIDERATIONS, which replace that one:

          - A BROWSER IS NOT BUNDLED. webhands ships no binary and Playwright
            would download a ~150 MB one per account, over Tor, into undeclared
            state. The `browser` option below is the answer: one declared
            executable, wrapped into the CLI itself, shared with the operator.
            Without it the skill describes verbs that fail at the first launch.
          - A LOGIN IS HEADED, AND THIS BOX HAS NO DISPLAY. `setup-profile`
            opens a visible window, which a jailed account on a headless machine
            cannot produce. The default here is scoped to the HEADLESS verbs
            (serve, snapshot, extract, eval), which need only a profile
            DIRECTORY, and that is declared. Minting a persona is an
            operator-driven act with a forwarded display, documented rather than
            automated.
          - A PERSONA BELONGS TO ONE SLOT (docs/adr/0021). The profile a slot
            logs in with is that slot's identity, and the homes are 0700 so the
            structure agrees with the instruction.
          - FINGERPRINT, twice over, and both are accepted rather than solved.
            A vanilla Chromium over Tor is far more fingerprintable than Tor
            Browser: this is adequate against "not attributable to the operator"
            and is NOT "anonymous against a determined cross-site correlator".
            It is stated in the AGENTS.md too, because the session's user is who
            needs to know.

        AND THE MODULE HEADER'S ARGUMENT, ANSWERED RATHER THAN IGNORED: an
        identical skill set across slots IS a shared behavioural signature. It
        is accepted, because it changes nothing that is not already true (every
        slot shares one AGENTS.md, one model list and one home layout, which are
        far stronger tells than a skill directory) and because the alternative
        is not "vary the skills" but "vary the instructions and the model",
        which this module deliberately does not offer. The property this
        arrangement actually provides is unlinkability from the OPERATOR, which
        no skill affects; unlinkability BETWEEN slots is weak by construction
        and is not improved by giving one slot a different reading list.

      description = ''
        Extra pi extensions for every anon home, as name -> PACKAGE, delivered
        from the store exactly as webTools delivers pi-webveil (ADR-0017).

        THE NAME IS DOCUMENTATION ONLY; what is rendered into settings.json is
        `''${package}/''${package.extensionSubdir}`, so the package must publish
        that passthru and an assertion below refuses one that does not. The
        reason is the same silent failure pi-webveil's own package header
        records: pi skips a `packages` entry whose path does not exist with no
        warning, no error and exit 0, so a wrong subpath costs an account its
        tools while looking exactly like an account that has them.

        WHY THIS IS NOT JUST webTools WITH MORE ENTRIES: webTools also renders a
        per-account webveil.json naming that account's own search socket, so it
        is a feature rather than a list. This option is the list.

        WHAT BELONGS HERE is an extension that is credential-free, needs no
        network at load, and reads only what the ACCOUNT can already read. The
        worked example is memonaut-pi, and it is worth stating why it qualifies,
        because the obvious reading is that a transcript searcher is exactly the
        wrong thing to hand an anon session: its index is
        `~/.local/share/memonaut/index.db`, per-HOME and 0600 (measured on this
        box), so a slot indexes its own sessions and cannot reach the
        operator's, which is 0700 away and, in a hosted session, not in the
        filesystem view at all. An extension that read a SHARED index would be
        refused on the same facts.

    browser = {
      enable = lib.mkEnableOption ''
        a browser for every anon home: a declared profile directory per slot,
        driven with the `webhands` CLI whose package carries the one browser
        executable this repo declares (ADR-0022).

        WHAT THIS OPTION ACTUALLY PLACES is a DIRECTORY, and that is the whole
        trick. The binary reaches the account through the system profile, and
        the browser reaches the binary through webhands' own wrapper, so neither
        is per-account and neither is declared here. What IS per-account is the
        profile, which webhands resolves under $HOME and refuses to create on a
        headless launch (a missing profile is a typed error, so a typo cannot
        silently spawn a blank one). Declaring the directory is what removes the
        need for the headed `setup-profile` flow, which has no display to open a
        window on here.

        THE SESSION SERVER IS A UNIX SOCKET HERE, AND THAT IS NOT OPTIONAL.
        webhands drives its browser from a long-lived `serve` process that each
        verb connects to, and until 0.8.0 that connection was LOOPBACK TCP,
        which an anon uid cannot use: anonctl's closure ends in
        `meta skuid <uid> ip daddr 127.0.0.0/8 drop`, the same rule ADR-0017 put
        the per-account SearXNG on a unix socket for. Measured on this box:
        `serve` reported healthy on 127.0.0.1 and every verb failed to reach it,
        with a curl to the same port TIMING OUT rather than being refused, which
        is the kernel drop rather than a dead server.

        webhands 0.8.0 serves over a socket instead (`--socket`, or
        `WEBHANDS_SOCKET`), and the endpoint file then carries the transport, so
        VERBS NEED NO FLAG. This module therefore exports that variable in the
        declared login profile rather than asking a session to remember a flag:
        a plain `webhands serve` is socket mode for an anon account, which is
        what the shipped use-webhands skill documents. Two consequences worth
        naming: `browser.enable` requires `loginEnv` (asserted below), because
        the profile is how the default travels; and the package must be 0.8.0 or
        later (also asserted), because an older one ignores both the flag and
        the variable and falls back to a TCP port nothing in the account can
        reach, silently.

        THE SOCKET LIVES IN THE HOME, not in /run, which is the opposite of
        where ADR-0017 put the search socket. The reasons that moved that one do
        not apply here: a stale socket cannot accumulate because webhands
        unlinks one before binding and removes it on stop (and refuses a path
        that exists and is not a socket); nothing walks or synchronises an anon
        home (`no anon path reaches syncthing` is an evaluated claim); and the
        endpoint file that advertises it is in `~/.webhands` already, so putting
        the socket elsewhere would split one lifecycle across two owners. The
        path is spelled `$HOME`-relative, so ONE declared profile serves every
        slot and no account name is needed to write it.

        HOSTED DASHBOARD SESSIONS GET THE SAME BROWSER, through
        modules/wherever-anon.nix rather than through this module: that unit
        declares its environment explicitly and never reads the login profile,
        so it derives WEBHANDS_SOCKET (from `socketPaths` below) and
        PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH (from the package's `browsers`) itself, and
        puts this package on its PATH. It could not before, because Chromium
        died under that unit's SystemCallFilter allowlist; the measured fix
        (allow capset, deny with EPERM) is recorded at that unit and in
        work/notes/findings/chromium-dies-under-a-systemcallfilter-allowlist.md

          The webhands package, whose wrapper carries the declared browser.

          TAKEN AS A PACKAGE RATHER THAN A BOOLEAN so this module can ASSERT
          that the browser exists: the package must publish a `browsers`
          passthru, which packages/webhands.nix sets to the bundle it wrapped
          the binary with. Without that assertion, a webhands built without a
          browser would place a profile directory, put a working-looking CLI on
          the account's path, and fail at the first launch with
          `missing-browser-binary` and an instruction to download 150 MB over
          Tor, which is the exact outcome the declaration exists to prevent.

          NOTE WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO WITH THE PACKAGE: it does not add it
          to any PATH. The binary is on the account's path because the HOST
          installs it box-wide, which is also what makes the executable shared
          with the operator rather than duplicated per slot. (The wherever-anon
          unit, which sees no box-wide profile, puts this same package on its
          own PATH.)

          rather than an oversight: it exports `$HOME/.webhands/session.sock`,
          which is the same path for every account without naming one, so a
          single declared file serves the whole pool. These absolute forms exist

          browser identities (a logged-in persona and a clean one); they cost an
          empty directory each until something launches against them.

          ONE NAMESPACE PER ACCOUNT, NEVER SHARED. Each path is built from the
          account's own home, and the homes are 0700 with a per-account group,
          so slot A cannot read slot B's cookies even though both are called
          `default`. An eval claim pins that derivation, because a profile root
          hoisted to a shared location is precisely the change that would look
          like tidying.

        Declare ~/.bash_profile for the account.

        The ANSWER TO "is the anon PATH sane?" is yes, and this option is not
        about that. anonctl's `use` hands the session
        PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin and leaves the refinement to a profile
        drop-in it writes only for accounts it CREATED -- which an adopted
        account, i.e. every account on this box, never gets. NixOS covers it
        anyway: /etc/profile sources set-environment, which OVERWRITES PATH with
        an absolute list carrying /run/current-system/sw/bin, so a login shell
        finds pi and anonctl. No host declaration is needed to make the account
        WORK.

        What this corrects is that the box-wide environment spells the
        operator's home in TEN variables, not just PATH: the profile-derived
        list (PATH, GTK_PATH, INFOPATH, LIBEXEC_PATH, QTWEBKIT_PLUGIN_PATH,
        TERMINFO_DIRS, XCURSOR_PATH, XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, XDG_DATA_DIRS,
        NIX_PROFILES) plus NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX. All unreachable from here, since
        that home is 0700, and all of them the operator's name sitting in an
        anon session's environment one `env` away from an agent's context.

        The file filters foreign /home entries out of those lists, unsets
        NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX, and touches nothing else. It is a MITIGATION: the
        root fix is that operator-specific prefixes should not be box-wide, and
        that change belongs to the modules that declare them.

        KNOW WHAT DECLARING THIS FILE COSTS: bash reads the FIRST of
        ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, ~/.profile, so declaring this one makes
        the other two dead letters for the account, and a login shell still
        does not read ~/.bashrc. Nothing in this fleet writes any of them for an
        anon account today, and /etc/bashrc is still reached through
        /etc/profile, so the practical loss is nil; it stops being nil the day a
        session writes ~/.bashrc and wonders why a login shell ignores it.

        Turn it off if the account's shell environment should be whatever the
        system hands it, unmodified.
