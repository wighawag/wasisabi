# A LOCAL MODEL SERVER: llama.cpp on the CPU, on the same machine, serving the
# OpenAI-compatible API over a UNIX SOCKET.
#
# WHY A UNIX SOCKET RATHER THAN A PORT, which is the whole shape of this module.
#
#   1. It is the only interface an anonctl-jailed account can reach without a
#      hole being punched in its jail. Every TCP connection an anon uid opens,
#      loopback included, is redirected into that account's Tor shim unless an
#      explicit `anonctl --allow 127.0.0.1:<port>` exemption says otherwise. A
#      unix socket is not IP traffic and traverses no nftables chain, so the
#      anon accounts reach the model with no exemption at all, gated by the
#      socket's GROUP instead (see `clientGroup`).
#   2. Access control is a file permission. A loopback port is open to every
#      local uid; the socket is open to its group.
#   3. The server needs no network, so it gets none: `PrivateNetwork = true`
#      puts llama-server in an empty network namespace. The process holding
#      every prompt on this machine cannot open a connection to anywhere,
#      which is a property a bound-to-loopback server can only promise.
#
# THE TCP PORT IS THE FALLBACK, not the design: most clients speak HTTP to a
# host:port and nothing else. `tcpPort` (on by default) adds a socket-activated
# `systemd-socket-proxyd` on 127.0.0.1 that forwards to the unix socket, for
# those clients. pi does NOT need it: the `pi-wasisabi-local` extension (see
# pkgs/pi-wasisabi-local) speaks HTTP over the socket directly. An anon account
# that must use the port needs the exemption, applied as root:
#
#   sudo anonctl update <account> --allow 127.0.0.1:<tcpPort>
#
# CPU BY DEFAULT, deliberately: this is a distro default, and the one
# accelerator every machine has is its CPU. The default model is small enough
# (Gemma 4 E4B, ~4.2 GB at 4 bits) to answer at a usable speed on a laptop, and
# `model` swaps in anything llama.cpp loads. A machine with a GPU sets
# `package = pkgs.llama-cpp.override { vulkanSupport = true; }` or similar.
