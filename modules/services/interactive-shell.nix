# modules/services/interactive-shell.nix
#
# Carried over from the my-boxes fleet (modules/interactive-shell.nix there,
# live on telemaque) with the option renamed to wasisabi.services.interactiveShell.
# `hosts/nono` and `modules/anon-home.nix` below are that repo's paths (the anon
# homes are ./anon-home.nix here). The only other change is that the flake
# check pinning the init order now reads the demo host's /etc/bashrc.
#
# The interactive bash stack: ble.sh (line editor: syntax highlighting,
# autosuggestions), fzf (Ctrl-T, Alt-C, `**` completion), zoxide (`z`), atuin
# (Ctrl-R history search) and starship (prompt). Bash stays the login shell; no
# framework (oh-my-bash, bash-it) is involved.
#
# BOX-WIDE, for every user, through /etc/bashrc. There is no per-user ~/.bashrc
# on these hosts, and home-manager is deliberately not used for it: it is
# per-user (every account would need its own), it would write rc files into the
# anon homes that modules/anon-home.nix already owns, and it tracks master
# while the hosts track a release (see the fzf skew noted in hosts/nono).
#
# WHY NOT THE UPSTREAM NIXOS MODULES (programs.fzf, programs.atuin,
# programs.starship, programs.zoxide, programs.bash.blesh), checked against the
# 26.05 sources rather than assumed:
#   - programs.fzf.keybindings lands in promptPluginInit, spliced into bash.nix's
#     own block, while atuin and zoxide are separate interactiveShellInit
#     definitions at the same priority. Whether atuin ends up AFTER fzf (and so
#     owns Ctrl-R) would depend on module import order. Nothing pins it.
#   - programs.bash.blesh sources ble.sh WITHOUT --noattach and never calls
#     ble-attach, which is the load order ble.sh itself recommends against.
#   - programs.atuin exports ATUIN_CONFIG_DIR=/etc/atuin to everyone (so a
#     user's ~/.config/atuin is silently ignored) and starts a per-user daemon.
# So this module installs the packages and writes ONE explicitly ordered init,
# split across the two ends of programs.bash.interactiveShellInit:
#
#   mkBefore (before bash.nix's own block):  1. ble.sh --noattach
#   mkAfter  (after everything else, including environment.interactiveShellInit):
#                                            2. fzf  3. zoxide  4. atuin
#                                            5. starship  6. ble-attach
#
# fzf is also told NOT to bind Ctrl-R at all (FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND set but empty,
# the switch fzf's own bash integration reads). The ordering alone did hand
# Ctrl-R to atuin when tested; this makes it not depend on atuin overwriting
# fzf's `bind -x` cleanly, and says "fzf, but not Ctrl-R" outright. atuin
# still comes after fzf. atuin detects
# ble.sh natively, so there is no bash-preexec. Atuin keeps the Up arrow as
# plain bash history (--disable-up-arrow) and gets no settings: sync stays off
# until a user runs `atuin login` themselves. Atuin AI is off too
# (--disable-ai): since 18.15 atuin otherwise binds `?`, and at an empty prompt
# that key opens an assistant backed by atuin's online service. The flake check
# `agent-layer` claims pin this order in the demo host's generated
# /etc/bashrc.
#
# ble.sh needs ~/.cache and ~/.local/state to EXIST (it will not create them,
# and falls back to its read-only store directory); the init creates them, and
# skips only ble.sh when a home is not writable.
#
# COLOURS: one palette, Catppuccin Mocha, for every piece that draws colour, so
# the prompt, the command line, fzf and `ls` agree. Each piece is given its
# colours as 24-bit hex (not the 16 named ANSI colours), so it looks the same
# whatever palette the user's terminal has; setting the terminal itself to
# Catppuccin Mocha makes everything else (git, compilers) match too.
#   - starship: the stock `catppuccin-powerline` preset, vendored verbatim in
#     modules/starship-catppuccin-powerline.toml, with the box's overrides
#     merged on top here (hostname over ssh only, no Node version, a NixOS logo,
#     no desktop notifications on a headless box). It is written to
#     /etc/starship.toml and pointed at with STARSHIP_CONFIG only when the
#     user has not set that already. Its powerline shapes and icons need a
#     Nerd Font in the user's terminal.
#   - ble.sh: `ble-face` overrides for the syntax-highlighting faces (its
#     defaults are 256-colour indices picked for a light background, e.g. the
#     autosuggestion on a light grey block). Filenames follow LS_COLORS.
#   - fzf: the Catppuccin FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS colours, minus `bg`, so fzf keeps the
#     terminal's own background. Only when FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS is unset.
#   - ls, fd, tree, ...: LS_COLORS from `vivid generate catppuccin-mocha`, done
#     at build time. Set after NixOS's own `dircolors` (programs.bash.enableLsColors),
#     which it replaces.
#
# GATE: interactive AND a terminal that can draw. `TERM=dumb` is what agent
# tool shells, Emacs M-x shell and scripted ssh sessions report; ble.sh cannot
# render there, and loading atuin there would record agents' commands into the
# user's history. Real terminals (emulators, ssh, zellij, vterm) get it all.
