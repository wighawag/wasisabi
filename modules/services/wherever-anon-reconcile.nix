# modules/wherever-anon-reconcile.nix
#
# THE WIRING that makes `anonctl add` the only verb: a boot-time oneshot plus a
# `.path` unit watching anonctl's own directories, both running the reconcile core
# (packages/anon-reconcile.nix, source in scripts/anon-reconcile.sh). It is
# `work/tasks/backlog/anon-ledger-reconcile-wiring.md` built, and it replaces
# scripts/anon-provision.sh, which did the same work by hand for one named account
# and is deleted.
#
# NOTHING HERE IS PER-ACCOUNT, and that is the property rather than a happy
# accident. One unit, one path unit, one wrapper, all named after the machinery
# and none after a slot, so adding an account re-evaluates no Nix and touches no
# repo file (spec story 15). The reconcile script discovers which slots exist by
# asking systemd for the declared `wherever-anon-*.socket` units, so even the slot
# POOL does not appear here.
#
# TWO DIRECTORIES ARE WATCHED, AND THE SECOND ONE IS NOT DECORATION.
#
#   /etc/anonctl/accounts   the LEDGER: one record per account anonctl manages.
#                           It changes on `anonctl add` and `anonctl rm`, which is
#                           the add/remove trigger.
#   /etc/anonctl            the MARKERS: one record per account anonctl has PROVEN
#                           anonymized, written only after `verify` passes and
#                           removed on `rm`.
#
# Watching only the ledger would make the gate in ADR-0019 operationally painful:
# an account added while its endpoint was down is managed but not yet proven, so
# reconcile refuses it, and nothing would ever re-run when `anonctl verify` later
# went green. Watching the marker directory closes that loop, so the interface
# appears by itself the moment the jail is provable, with no operator command. In
# the ordinary case both land inside one `anonctl add` (it runs verify inline and
# writes the marker on green), so `add` really is the only verb.
#
# A `.path` unit watches a directory that does not exist yet by watching its
# ancestors, so a box where `anonctl add` has never run (every freshly born
# machine, spec story 1) is a supported, inert state rather than a failure.
#
# ORDERING AFTER anonctl-nftables.service IS LOAD-BEARING AT BOOT. The forced gate
# asks the KERNEL whether the account's rules are loaded right now, so running
# before anonctl's own boot-time loader would see no rules and retract every anon
# route. Read the other way round, that is the property this buys: if anonctl's
# ruleset ever fails to load, reconcile retracts the routing instead of serving
# interfaces whose sessions are no longer jailed.

      which mints a handle, a token and a colorway, writes the account's state and
      its routing fragment, and starts the instance's socket. `anonctl rm <name>`

        Needs 0.7.0+, which added `probe`. Before it, this script asked the kernel
        itself by grepping the account's nft table for `skuid <uid>`, which was
        both a coupling to anonctl's private table naming AND wrong: it matched
        the uid anywhere in the table, so a table that was loaded but did not
        FUNNEL that uid into the fail-closed chain read as jailed. Measured on
        this box against 0.7.0's own generated ruleset in a network namespace:
        remove the single `meta skuid <uid> jump anon_filter` line and the grep
        still says jailed, while probe says `uid-not-governed`.

        anonctl's LEDGER: one `<account>.json` per account it manages, mode 0700
        with 0600 files. THE seam, and the only coupling to anonctl there will
        ever be.

        Reconcile reads the FILENAMES and never the contents: their shape is
        anonctl's business, and guessing it is how you build something that works
        on one box and silently misreads another.

        STILL NOT `anonctl list --json`, but the reason has MOVED and the old one
        must not be repeated: as of anonctl 0.7.0 that command is honest. It no
        longer carries the `forced` zero value at all, forcing is an explicit
        tri-state, and a new `managed` field distinguishes a declared-but-never-
        added slot from one anonctl actually manages, which was the specific trap
        this fleet fell into (the whole anon pool is declared here, so every slot
        is in passwd from the first converge). Reading `list` today would be
        correct. The 0.6.x hazard is recorded, with its resolution, in
        work/notes/findings/anonctl-list-enumerates-passwd-and-its-forced-field-is-a-zero-value.md

        What keeps the DIRECTORY as the seam is a different property: this is an
        inotify watcher, not a poller. `.path` units watch paths, so the thing
        reconcile is triggered BY and the thing it enumerates should be the same
        thing, or the two can disagree about what just happened. A ledger file
        appearing IS the add event; asking a command afterwards is a second
        reading of a world that may have moved again. Filenames also stay the
        narrowest possible dependency: no output shape to version, nothing to
        re-verify when anonctl changes a field, and no process spawned per
        trigger.
