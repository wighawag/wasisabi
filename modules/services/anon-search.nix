# modules/anon-search.nix
#
# A SearXNG per anon account, RUNNING AS THAT ACCOUNT'S OWN LOGIN UID and
# serving HTTP over a unix socket in that account's home. This is ADR-0017
# built. Pairs with modules/anon-home.nix, which delivers the pi-webveil
# extension and writes the `webveil.json` that names these sockets.
#
# WHY AS THE ACCOUNT'S UID, which is the whole design in one sentence. anonctl's
# forcing rules match `meta skuid <uid>`, so a daemon running under the
# account's uid is forced by exactly the same kernel rules as the account's
# interactive shell: its egress goes through the account's shim into Tor, and
# Tor's `<account>@` SOCKS isolation gives it that account's own circuit with
# nothing to configure. Two accounts get two circuits as a CONSEQUENCE of the
# design rather than as a setting someone must remember.
#
# The alternative (a shared SearXNG beside the accounts, reached through a
# loopback exemption, anonymised by its own proxy config) was rejected in
# ADR-0017 because of where the anonymity would then live: if `egressProxies`
# were empty, misspelled or pointed at a dead port, every search would leave via
# the box's real IP WHILE `anonctl verify` CONTINUED TO REPORT 15/15, because
# verify measures the account's own sockets and cannot see a helper service
# making requests on its behalf. Here, even a wholly tampered SearXNG cannot
# deanonymise the account, because its packets are still forced by the kernel.
#
# A UNIX SOCKET IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. An anon account CANNOT SERVE A LOOPBACK
# TCP PORT AT ALL: anonctl's closure ends in
# `meta skuid <anon> ip daddr 127.0.0.0/8 drop`, and an inbound connection's
# REPLY packets carry the LISTENING socket owner's uid, so the SYN arrives (there
# is no input chain) and the SYN-ACK is dropped. The handshake never completes.
# A loopback exemption does NOT rescue it either: anonctl's exemption clause is a
# single `tcp dport` match and the reply direction's dport is an ephemeral port
# no exemption can name. A unix socket is not IP traffic and traverses no
# nftables chain at all. All measured:
# work/notes/findings/anon-uid-cannot-serve-inbound-tcp-the-reply-is-dropped.md
#
# NOT A uWSGI VASSAL, AND THIS REVERSED AN ADR DECISION. nixpkgs' services.uwsgi
# declares exactly ONE systemd unit (the Emperor) and vassals are its child
# processes, while systemd socket activation hands an fd to a systemd SERVICE
# via LISTEN_FDS. So "an additional vassal" and "socket-activated" are mutually
# exclusive, and these are standalone service+socket units OUTSIDE the Emperor.
# `services.searx` is a singleton and is not touched at all, which makes this
# purely additive: the operator's own instance cannot regress.
#
# `http-socket = fd://3` IS MANDATORY AND NON-OBVIOUS. uWSGI auto-adopts a
# systemd-passed fd as a *uwsgi-protocol* socket, which webveil cannot read; an
# HTTP request against that yields `invalid request block size: ...skip` and an
# empty body. The explicit `fd://3` is what makes the inherited fd speak HTTP.
# Measured, along with the other two socket-activation traps (vacuum is safe;
# chmod-socket/chown-socket are unnecessary because systemd owns the socket):
# work/notes/findings/pi-loads-store-path-extensions-and-uwsgi-socket-activation-needs-fd3.md
#
# ONE INSTANCE PER DECLARED SLOT, DELIBERATELY, and socket activation is what
# makes that free. The instance set does NOT follow which accounts are actually
# forced: that would need an explicit list in the host file (anonctl's ledger is
# imperative state Nix cannot read), and such a list would record WHICH SLOTS
# ARE IN USE AND WHEN EACH BECAME SO, IN GIT HISTORY, which is precisely the
# timing leak modules/anon-accounts.nix declares its whole pool at once to avoid.
# An unused instance costs a socket inode and no Python process (measured), so
# uniform declaration costs nothing.
#
# SEARCH QUALITY IS PER-ACCOUNT AND IT FLICKERS, which is a consequence of the
# circuit isolation above rather than a defect, and is written down here because
# a live session hit it and it looked like a bug. Each account is pinned to its
# OWN Tor exit (that is the point), and engines gate on a per-exit REQUEST
# BUDGET spent largely by strangers sharing that exit, so an engine can refuse
# one request and answer the next. Measured on this box, on one account's own
# exit: duckduckgo returned 403 then 200, while bing returned 200 then failed,
# within minutes. Two consequences are designed for rather than hoped away: the
# engine list is FOUR so that a flicker degrades the result instead of emptying
# it, and the suspension times are minutes rather than upstream's days so that
# one refusal does not remove an engine until tomorrow.
#
# NO KEYED ENGINE, EVER. The operator's instance has a Brave API key; an anon
# instance must not, because an API key is both a credential and an attributable
# ACCOUNT, so it would tie every search to a payment identity and undo the
# entire exercise. That is why this module is short while modules/searxng.nix is
# 756 lines: most of that module is the key machinery (searx-init, the envsubst
# grammar, the substitution guard, the secret-grammar assertions), and none of
# it applies here.
#
# AND NO `outgoing.proxies`, WHICH LOOKS LIKE AN OMISSION AND IS NOT. The
# operator's instance NEEDS egressProxies (its crawl goes out through Mullvad
# because the house IP was flagged). This one must NOT have them: its egress is
# already forced by the kernel, a proxy here would be a second hop the forcing
# redirects anyway, and the account cannot reach any proxy port but its own
# shim's, so it would simply fail closed. Same inversion as the `egress =
# direct` in each account's webveil.json, and the same trap for a later editor.

          bing        answers, full result pages, but shallow on technical
                      queries: it returned project landing pages where mwmbl
                      returned the actual topic.
          mwmbl       answers, and kept answering on an exit where duckduckgo
                      was 403 and bing was failing.

          startpage   not an engine at all: `inactive: true` upstream in this
                      package vintage, a proof-of-work captcha.
          marginalia  likewise `inactive: true` upstream, so unavailable.

        WHY FOUR AND NOT THE TWO BIG ONES. mwmbl and wiby are small indexes that
        will not carry a general query alone, and they are here for REDUNDANCY
        rather than reach. Engine availability on Tor flickers minute to minute
        because the gate is a per-exit REQUEST BUDGET spent largely by strangers
        (work/notes/findings/search-engine-gatekeeping-by-egress-class.md), and
        a Tor exit is the worst case for that model. Measured on this box: on
        one account's own exit, duckduckgo went 403 then 200, and bing went 200
        then failed, within minutes of each other. With two engines such a
        flicker returns an EMPTY result set, which is what a live session hit;
        with four it degrades instead. They cost nothing when they fail.
