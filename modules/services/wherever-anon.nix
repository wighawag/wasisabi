# modules/wherever-anon.nix
#
# A wherever instance per anon account, RUNNING AS THAT ACCOUNT'S OWN LOGIN UID
# and serving over a unix socket that Caddy reaches with `reverse_proxy
# unix/<path>`. This is `work/tasks/backlog/wherever-anon-instance-unit.md`
# built, and it is the sibling of modules/anon-search.nix: both are per-account
# daemons running as the account, and they answer every shared question the same
# way on purpose.
#
# WHY AS THE ACCOUNT'S UID. anonctl's forcing rules match `meta skuid <uid>`, so
# a daemon under the account's uid is forced by exactly the same kernel rules as
# the account's interactive shell. That matters more here than for search,
# because wherever hosts agent sessions IN-PROCESS: there is no `pi` child, so a
# session's uid IS the server's uid. Run this as anything else and the sessions
# are not jailed at all, which is the entire feature gone while everything still
# looks healthy.
#
# A UNIX SOCKET IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE, AND IT COST AN UPSTREAM FEATURE. An anon
# account CANNOT SERVE A LOOPBACK TCP PORT AT ALL: anonctl's closure ends in
# `meta skuid <anon> ip daddr 127.0.0.0/8 drop`, and an inbound connection's
# REPLY packets carry the LISTENING socket owner's uid, so the SYN arrives
# (there is no input chain) and the SYN-ACK is dropped. The handshake never
# completes. A loopback exemption does NOT rescue it: anonctl's exemption clause
# is a single `tcp dport` match and the reply direction's dport is an ephemeral
# port no exemption can name. Measured, along with a unix-socket control that
# counted zero packets on any rule:
# work/notes/findings/anon-uid-cannot-serve-inbound-tcp-the-reply-is-dropped.md
#
# The task that specified this was written before that was known, and wherever
# could not satisfy it either: through 0.15.2 the only listen call in the server
# was `server.listen(port, host, cb)`, with no `--socket`, no LISTEN_FDS handling
# and no `{fd:}` listen anywhere. So the feature was added UPSTREAM (wherever
# 0.16.0) rather than worked around here, and this module is its first consumer.
#
# `--socket fd://3`, NOT `--socket <path>`, AND THE REASON IS CROSS-UID. Both
# forms exist upstream. The path form makes the server create the socket, so the
# socket is owned by whoever the server already is, and reaching it from Caddy
# (a DIFFERENT uid) would need a shared supplementary group and a 0750 parent
# directory: the same dance modules/searxng.nix does for the operator's
# instance. The fd form lets systemd create, bind, chown and chmod the socket AS
# ROOT before this process exists, so `SocketUser`/`SocketGroup`/`SocketMode`
# below place a correctly-owned socket directly. anon-search could skip all of
# this because its consumer was the SAME uid (0600 plus ownership sufficed);
# here the consumer is Caddy, so the socket is 0660 account:caddy and only the
# supervisor could have made it so.
#
# ONE INSTANCE PER DECLARED SLOT, exactly as modules/anon-search.nix does, and
# for the same privacy reason rather than for tidiness. The instance set does
# NOT follow which accounts are actually forced: that would need an explicit
# list in the host file (anonctl's ledger is imperative state Nix cannot read),
# and such a list would record WHICH SLOTS ARE IN USE AND WHEN EACH BECAME SO,
# IN GIT HISTORY, which is the timing leak modules/anon-accounts.nix declares its
# whole pool at once to avoid. Socket activation is what makes that free: an
# unused instance is a socket inode and no node process.
#
# DECLARED VERSUS OBSERVED IS THE RULE, not name-versus-no-name. A slot name MAY
# appear in evaluated output and in store paths, because the pool is declared in
# full from the first commit so a slot's existence reveals nothing; ADR-0017
# ruled this explicitly and modules/anon-accounts.nix, modules/anon-home.nix and
# modules/anon-search.nix all rely on it. What must NEVER reach evaluated output
# is anything revealing WHICH slots are in use, WHEN, or BY WHOM: the handle, the
# token, the COLORWAY ASSIGNMENT and any socket path drawn from live state. Note
# the asymmetry: the palette is declared and generic, so palette entry NAMES are
# fine in the store, while the mapping from a slot to its colorway is observed
# state and is not. That is why the palette is a store file and the assignment is
# a runtime read. Older drafts of the task and the spec describe a `%i` TEMPLATE
# unit; that mechanism is superseded (it pushes the name into runtime state, so
# nothing can be checked at eval time) while its reasoning is kept whole.
#
# PRIVATETMP IS LOAD-BEARING FOR PRIVACY HERE TOO, and for a STRONGER reason
# than in anon-search. There the shared path was SearXNG's fixed-name /tmp cache,
# which collided. Here it is a READ channel exposed over HTTP: wherever's
# `resolveDownloadRoots` ALWAYS adds the resolved upload directory to the set of
# roots `/session/download` will serve from, and `resolveUploadDir` defaults to
# `os.tmpdir()`. So with the default upload config a shared /tmp makes every
# readable file under /tmp fetchable by whoever holds that instance's token,
# including other slots' uploads (written `<timestamp>_<filename>`, mode 0644)
# and anything the operator left there. Verified by reading the pinned server
# source, not assumed. A private /tmp makes each instance's upload dir and
# download root its own, which is both the fix and the right lifetime for an
# anon session's scratch files.

        KEYED BY NAME RATHER THAN BY INDEX so that re-ordering or extending the

        resolved colour, which keeps that state minimal and lets the palette be
        re-tuned here without rewriting live per-account state.

        is observed state and stays on the box. That asymmetry is the whole

          # `Restart = "on-failure"` with `RestartSec = 2` (which this module

          # HARMFUL here, because this unit has a DETERMINISTIC startup failure
          # that anon-search does not: it refuses to start when the account has
          # no state or no token, which is the state of EVERY slot until
          # reconcile provisions it.
          #
          # Measured on this box in a `systemd --user` manager, because the
          # obvious reading ("the start limit catches it") is WRONG. Restarting
          # every 2 seconds is EXACTLY the default 5-starts-per-10s limit, so the
          # limit is never exceeded and systemd NEVER GIVES UP: NRestarts reached
          # 15 and was still climbing from a single connection, spawning a
          # process and a log line every two seconds indefinitely.
          #
          # WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, stated plainly so nobody re-derives it the
          # hard way. Dropping Restart does NOT keep the socket alive through a
          # startup refusal. A socket-activated service that fails without
          # CONSUMING its pending connection makes systemd re-trigger activation
          # until the start limit, and then the .socket unit fails too. Measured:
          # 5 attempts, then service AND socket both `failed`. Exiting 0 instead
          # of 1 does not help either (same 5 attempts, same dead socket),
          # because the connection is still pending; only actually accepting the
          # connection would avoid it, and that would mean serving while
          # unauthenticated, which is the one thing this unit must never do.
          #
          # So the real choice is between an UNBOUNDED loop and a BOUNDED,
          # visible, repairable failure, and this takes the latter: it fails
          # closed, it shows up in `systemctl --failed`, and it is repaired by
          # exactly `systemctl reset-failed <unit>.socket <unit>.service` then
          # `systemctl start <unit>.socket` (verified: the next connection then
          # serves normally). That repair belongs to reconcile, which is the
          # thing that provisions the state in the first place, and it is
          # recorded in anon-ledger-reconcile-core's state-shape contract.
          #
          # In the normal flow this never fires: the dispatcher only routes to
          # slots reconcile has provisioned, so nothing connects to an
          # unprovisioned one.

          # adds the resolved upload dir to what `/session/download` will serve,

          # every readable file under /tmp fetchable by whoever holds this
          # instance's token: other slots' uploads, and whatever the operator

          #     within those sets, i.e. it can only drop what it does not have.
          #   - a denied call returns EPERM instead of KILLING the process. This
          #     permits nothing new (the denied set is the same set), it only
          #     makes a denial survivable. The cost, stated: code probing the

          #     dying, and a session can no longer be killed by a stray `nice`.

          # allow all five. It works, and it opens four more calls to buy
          # nothing Chromium needs. Unconditional rather than tied to
          # browser.enable, because a session can launch ANY Chromium (a repo's
          # own Playwright) and the measurement applies to it just the same.
