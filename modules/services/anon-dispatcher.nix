# THE ANON DISPATCHER, LOCAL-ONLY: one Caddy site that routes an opaque handle
# to one anon account's wherever socket, reachable from THIS machine only.
#
#   http://<handle>.localhost:<port>/#token=<token>
#
# This is the laptop-shaped version of the my-boxes fleet's dispatcher (its
# modules/reverse-proxy.nix `anonDispatcher`), which serves a wildcard
# certificate on a real domain so a phone can reach it over a mesh. The routing
# half is identical and was carried over unchanged: the store config holds the
# wildcard site and a glob `import` and NOTHING else (no account name, no
# handle, no socket path), and reconcile writes one fragment per account
# outside the store. What changed is the transport:
#
#   - `*.localhost` resolves to loopback by specification (RFC 6761), in every
#     current browser and in glibc through nss-myhostname, so there is no DNS
#     record, no domain and no certificate to own.
#   - plain HTTP on a loopback bind. A loopback origin is a secure context to
#     browsers, and the traffic never leaves the machine, so TLS here would be
#     ceremony. The bind is what keeps it local: nothing but this machine can
#     connect, whatever the firewall says.
#
# The token stays in the URL FRAGMENT, which is never sent to the server, so it
# cannot reach Caddy's access log either way.
#
# Reaching an anon interface from another device is deliberately not offered
# here. The fleet version exists for that and carries the costs that come with
# it (a domain, DNS-01, certificate transparency); a machine that wants it
# should use that shape rather than widen this bind.
