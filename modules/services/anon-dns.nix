# modules/anon-dns.nix
#
# WHAT A BOX MUST DECLARE so that anonctl can actually confine an anon account's
# DNS. Sibling to modules/anon-accounts.nix, which declares the passwd slots and
# says in its own header that it declares users and nothing else; this module is
# the other half of "what anonctl needs from a declarative host", and it is
# box-wide networking rather than user declaration, so it lives on its own.
#
# It exists because a correctly jailed account on telemaque was measured leaking
# every hostname it looked up while `anonctl verify` reported all ten assertions
# green (anonctl's work/notes/findings/dns-confinement-defeated-by-nss-delegation-and-reply-un-nat.md,
# and its docs/adr/0011). Two independent defects, neither of which anonctl can
# fix from inside the account, because all three levers here are global host
# state owned by other modules.
#
# DEFECT 1: THE ACCOUNT'S NAMES ARE RESOLVED BY ANOTHER PROCESS.
# anonctl forces egress with `meta skuid <uid>`, which matches a socket's OWNER.
# glibc asks an nscd-compatible socket for the `hosts` database BEFORE it reads
# nsswitch.conf at all, and NixOS runs nsncd, so every `getaddrinfo` an anon
# account makes executes inside nsncd's process under uid `nscd`. No rule anonctl
# can write governs that socket. Measured: a name nothing could have cached
# resolved for the account while every counter on its own sockets stayed at zero.
#
# The fix is to make the daemon refuse the hosts database, which makes glibc fall
# back to resolving IN the calling process, on the account's own socket, where the
# forcing applies. That fallback is the load-bearing behaviour and it was measured
# rather than assumed (two nsncd instances, one default and one with the variable,
# each reached through a mount namespace whose resolv.conf pointed at a dead
# server: the default one RESOLVED a tailnet name, i.e. answered from the host's
# real resolver, and the ignoring one FAILED, i.e. glibc resolved in-process and
# hit the dead server).
#
# COST: nsncd exists so foreign-libc binaries (nix-ld, steam-run, FHS envs) can
# use this glibc's NSS plugins. With hosts ignored they resolve with their own
# libc instead, keeping `files` and `dns` but losing `mdns`/`mymachines`. Native
# programs are unaffected, and nsncd is non-caching, so no cache is lost. passwd
# and group are untouched, which is what NixOS actually needs nsncd for.
#
# DEFECT 2: THE SHIM'S ANSWER IS DESTROYED ON THE WAY BACK.
# The account's query IS redirected into anonctl's shim, and the shim DOES answer
# it over Tor. The answer then dies: conntrack un-NATs the reply's source back to
# the NAMESERVER's address before delivering it, and with MagicDNS as the system
# resolver that address (100.100.100.100) is inside 100.64.0.0/10, which
# tailscaled's own `ts-input` chain drops when it arrives on any interface other
# than tailscale0. Measured on the rule's own counters: the query was accepted (its
# source is this node's tailnet address, which has an explicit accept) and the
# answer was dropped, +89 bytes, across one probe.
#
# That rule is tailscaled's and is correct on its own terms, so the fix is to stop
# handing it a packet to judge: with a LOOPBACK system resolver the whole exchange
# stays on lo, where no source-address filter looks at it. This is general, not a
# Tailscale workaround: an off-box nameserver exposes the account's DNS answers to
# every ingress filter on the box, re-decided on every update of every such tool.
#
# THE TRAP IN THE OBVIOUS FIX, which is why the nssDatabases line below is forced:
# enabling systemd-resolved also makes nixpkgs add `resolve [!UNAVAIL=return]` to
# `system.nssDatabases.hosts` (nixos/modules/system/boot/resolved.nix, mkOrder
# 501). nss-resolve hands getaddrinfo to systemd-resolved over varlink, under uid
# `systemd-resolve`: the SAME out-of-process resolution nsncd was doing, just with
# a different daemon. Enabling resolved without removing that entry trades one
# bypass for the other and anonctl's `dns-nss-not-bypassed` stays red. We want the
# stub LISTENER without the NSS module.

    the host-side DNS configuration an anonctl anon account needs in order to be
    confined at all: an nscd-compatible daemon that does NOT answer the hosts
    database (so glibc resolves in the calling process, on the account's own
    socket, where `meta skuid` governs it), and a LOOPBACK system resolver (so the
    shim's answer is never un-NATed onto a source address some ingress filter
    drops). Neither is something anonctl can do from inside the account: both are
    global host state. See the header of this module for the measurements

    # HALF TWO: a loopback system resolver. tailscaled detects systemd-resolved

    # so the ONLY change is that resolved's entry never joins it.
    #
    # The cost of mkForce is that a future nixpkgs addition to this list would be
    # silently dropped here, which is exactly why the assertion below exists: it
