# modules/anon-accounts.nix
#
# DECLARED SLOTS for anonctl's anon accounts, so that a box running
# `users.mutableUsers = false` can run anonctl at all. Declares users and
# NOTHING else -- no nftables, no shim unit, no anonctl invocation. anonctl still
# owns the forcing; this module owns only the passwd entries it forces.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is a fail-OPEN hazard rather than a convenience.
# anonctl creates its accounts out of band (`useradd`, via anoncore/provision),
# so they are undeclared by construction. NixOS with `mutableUsers = false`
# treats the Nix configuration as the authoritative user database and REMOVES
# any undeclared account on every activation -- which means every boot and every
# `nixos-rebuild switch`. Measured on telemaque 2026-09-21, the boot ordering
# says it plainly (anonctl's own
# work/notes/findings/nixos-account-conventions-break-anonctl-provisioning.md):
#
#   13:29:41  NixOS Activation ...              <- deletes both accounts
#   13:29:42  anonctl-nftables.service Finished <- restores forcing for uid
#                                                  1002 / 992, deleted 1s ago
#
# What survives is worse than nothing: nft tables, the shim unit, the home
# directory and /etc/anonctl/accounts/<account>.json all still reference UIDs
# that are now FREE FOR REALLOCATION, while the ledger still records the account
# as jailed. Two ways that bites, both silent:
#
#   - UID REUSE JAILS A STRANGER. The next account NixOS creates can be handed
#     that uid and silently inherits the forcing: every TCP connection
#     redirected into a shim it knows nothing about.
#   - RECREATION UNJAILS THE REAL ACCOUNT. Recreate the anon account and it may
#     get a DIFFERENT uid. The old rules then match nobody, the new account is
#     completely unforced, and /etc/anonctl still says it is jailed. That is the
#     exact "still exists, still looks anonymised" failure anonctl exists to
#     prevent, reached from a direction its design did not anticipate.
#
# THE ALTERNATIVE WE REJECTED: `users.mutableUsers = true`. It stops the
# deletion, but on NixOS a declarative password is applied to an account that
# ALREADY EXISTS only when mutableUsers is FALSE -- update-users-groups.pl does
# `$sp_pwdp = $u->{hashedPassword} if defined $u->{hashedPassword} &&
# !$spec->{mutableUsers}; # FIXME`, and `hashedPasswordFile` is read into that
# same field so it passes through the same gate. telemaque manages root's and
# the operator's passwords through sops (hosts/telemaque/default.nix), so
# flipping the flag would make both advisory: rotate the secret, deploy it, and
# the box silently keeps the old password. That is the 2026-09-15 incident this
# fleet already had once. Declaring the accounts costs nothing by comparison.
#
# PINNED UIDS ARE THE POINT, not tidiness. A pinned uid is what closes the
# "UID reuse jails a stranger" hole above: the number cannot drift, so an
# orphaned table can only ever name the account it was written for. Pick them
# AWAY FROM BOTH ALLOCATION FRONTS, because NixOS allocates system uids
# DESCENDING from 999 and normal uids ASCENDING from 1000 (allocUid in
# update-users-groups.pl: `($min,$max,$delta) = $isSystemUser ? (400,999,-1) :
# (1000,29999,1)`). A declared uid is excluded from allocation, so any free
# number is CORRECT, but one taken from the middle of the range is also STABLE:
# it will not be contended as services come and go. Hence 11xx for logins
# (ascending front is at 1002) and 44x for shims (descending front is at 992).
#
# NAMING IS A PRIVACY CONTROL, AND sops CANNOT HELP. An account name is
# structurally public on the machine: /etc/passwd is world-readable, so is
# /nix/store/<hash>-users-groups.json (52 names in plaintext on telemaque),
# /home/<account> is a directory anyone can stat, and `anonctl-shim@<account>`
# is a unit name any unprivileged `systemctl list-units` prints. On top of that
# the name sits in this repo's git history. No secret-management tool closes
# this: Nix evaluates `users.users.<name>` at BUILD time whereas sops-nix
# decrypts at ACTIVATION time, so an encrypted value can never become an account
# name, and if it somehow did the result would land in that world-readable store
# path anyway.
#
# So the name MUST carry no information. Use SLOT IDS (`anon`, `anon-01`) or
# placeholder personas that say as little (`anon-john`, `anon-jane`: John and
# Jane Doe, which is what telemaque uses because they are easier to remember),
# never a purpose and never a real name, and keep the slot-to-purpose mapping in
# the operator's own secret store. anoncore builds `anon-<name>` and
# `<account>-shim` from whatever is passed (anoncore/account/account.go), so the
# part after `anon-` is exactly what `anonctl add` takes (`anonctl add john`).
#
# AND DECLARE THE POOL IN ONE COMMIT. A slot added later leaks TIMING -- when an
# identity was created -- which is often the most sensitive fact available, and
# a live passwd file that grows leaks how many are in use. A fixed pool keeps
# both constant. Unused slots are inert: with mutableUsers = false and no
# password declared here, every one of these accounts gets `!` in /etc/shadow,
# none is in wheel, and none has an authorized key, so an un-added slot cannot
# be logged into at all. It is a reserved number and a directory, nothing more.
#
# ANONCTL ADOPTS WHAT IT FINDS, which is what makes this work rather than fight:
# "Provisioning each account is a no-op if it already exists, so re-running add
# is a clean no-op" (anoncore/provision/provision.go:136). It checks each account
# and creates only what is absent, and it DISCOVERS the uid rather than assuming
# one. So `anonctl add 01` on a box carrying these declarations skips creation
# and goes straight to forcing.
#
# DECLARE BOTH HALVES OF A SLOT. provision.go:145 calls a login account that
# exists with no shim a state "the operator has to clean up by hand", so this
# module always emits the pair and never lets a host declare half of one.
#
# SHELLS ARE DECLARED AS PACKAGES, WHICH IS HOW THEY BECOME STABLE ALIASES.
# NixOS's `toShellPath` renders a `shellPackage` as `/run/current-system/sw` plus
# the package's own `shellPath`, so `pkgs.bashInteractive` becomes
# `/run/current-system/sw/bin/bash` and `pkgs.shadow` becomes
# `/run/current-system/sw/bin/nologin`. That is the GC-safe form: a literal
# `/nix/store/<hash>-bash-.../bin/bash` in /etc/passwd is correct until the next
# rebuild collects it, the same time bomb anonctl records for unit ExecStart
# paths in its own repo's
# work/notes/observations/resolved-unit-binaries-can-bake-a-nix-store-path-from-path.md.
# Writing the alias as a bare string would work too, but the package form is
# type-checked (`shellPackage`) where a string is not, so a typo fails the build
# rather than producing an account with a shell that is not there. anonctl's
# docs/nixos.md recommends exactly this form.
#
# A DEDICATED GROUP PER ACCOUNT, rather than the shared `users`. This is the one
# place where matching what `useradd` would have done is WORSE than improving on
# it: NixOS sets GROUP=100, so an account anonctl creates out of band lands in
# `users`, which on this box is also the operator's own group (uid 1001). Sharing
# it would make every group-readable file mutually visible between the operator
# and an account whose entire purpose is to be unlinkable to them. Declaring the
# accounts is precisely how that group is gained back, and anonctl's
# docs/nixos.md makes the same call. The gids are deliberately NOT pinned: the
# forcing matches `meta skuid` only, so the uid is the thing that must not move.
