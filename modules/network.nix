  # LOOPBACK IS NOT NEGOTIABLE and is why no address option is offered. A SOCKS
  # listener reachable off-box is an OPEN PROXY, and "anonymous egress for
  # anyone on the LAN" is not something to leave one setting away. nixpkgs'
  # default already binds 127.0.0.1 with IsolateDestAddr (per-destination
  # circuit isolation, so two sites cannot be correlated by sharing an exit),
  # which is the right behaviour, so this deliberately does NOT override
  # `settings.SOCKSPort`. Note that option is a LIST and therefore CONCATENATES
  # rather than replaces: defining it here would add a SECOND listener on the
  # same port, which cannot bind and fails the unit at startup.
